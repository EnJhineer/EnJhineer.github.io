       <h2 id="about">What is the Venus Flytrap?</h2>
       <p class="info"><em>Dionaea muscipula</em>, more commonly known as the Venus Flytrap, is a <b>carnivorous</b> plant well known for its signature way of obtaining its food. The magnificent way it does this is by using its famous leaves, which are shaped like pincers. Once a prey item ends up in between the leaves, the leaves slam shut, and additionaly have needle-like structures on top to prevent the prey item from escaping. Interesting, right? To learn that there is a plant that relies on predation to exist sounds like something from a science fiction movie. But worry not, for they eat mostly small creatures that can fit in their trap, and if even if you do somehow get into a situation where they bite you, just think that these plants are small, in fact the dangerous leaves grow up to a measly length of 1 inch. </p>

       <h2 id="camp">What is their conservation status?</h2>
       <p class="info">According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, they are currently listed as <b>"Vulnerable"</b>. They require very specific conditions to grow well, of which only the moist and acidic soil of the swamps of the East Coast can give. Not only that, but also they are threatened by the problems of over-harvesting and habitat loss, both of which are caused by humans. It is a harsh truth, but it we can do something about it. Let us work together, to prevent the Venus Flytrap from going farther down the IUCN Red List, by doing the simple act of gardening.</p>
